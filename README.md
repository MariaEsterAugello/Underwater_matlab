# Underwater
# - Mission parameters may be modified by using mission.m
# - At first, the main file to run on Matlab 2019b is init_all.m
# - The simulation is sim_all_2019b.slx, suggested time 2000, the simulation will automatically end when finished
# - To see the 3D plot of the results it is necessary to run Environment_Model.m
# - Plot2D.m create a 2D graphic representation to see the differences between estimated position and real position
